# Welcome to  Django-Vercel skeleton repo!

Hi! I i found a way to deploy django apps FOR FREE on web here are the steps:
- Clone this repo.
- Connect it to your vercel account.
- Set environment variables as shown in `env_example` file.
- Add you own logic to the app, like normal you would in normal django.


## Important

- There is only one `requirements.txt` file for production, if you want to have different requirements locally put them in separate file.
- There is no way (I can think of) of developing more services than just django.
- 1 postgres database is for free
- `statics and media` files won't work until you provide AWS S3 bucket into the project
